/*Applications of Recursion
1. Many algorithm techniques are based on recursion
      i. Dynamic Programming
      ii. Backracking
      iii. Divide and Conquer (Binary Search, Quicksort, Merge sort )
      
2. Many problems inherntly recursive
      i.Tower of Hanoi
      ii. DFS based traversals (DFS graph and Inorder/preorder/ postorder traversal of tree)*/
